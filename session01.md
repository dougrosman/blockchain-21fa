### Assignments

#### **1. READ: Artists Re:Thinking the Blockchain (submit responses to Canvas)**

Task: Read the following excerpts and write down at least 3 things:

   1. What is a term you encountered that you would like explained further?
   2. What is a question you have after reading any of these?
   3. What is a comment you have about something you read?

Read: **A Quasi Proto Preface + Introduction** (pg. 9-34)
Read: **FinBook: Literary Content as Digital Commodity** (41-49)
Read: **Love on the Block â€“ Max Dovey** (251-259)

Note: The first note in this chapter reads as follows: *"In practice, we do not use the blockchain, but we would invite the reader to imagine that we do, as it makes the technical development significantly easier, without materially affecting the experience."* (Use this as a guiding principle for this class. Meaning, you don't to materially use a blockchain in order to conceptually use a blockchain)

#### **Do: The aesthetics of exchange.**

Write out a blueprint/concept for a cryptocurrency/token. You can build on the currency you created in class, or start fresh. **We will each give 2-3 minute presentations at the end of class next week where we "shill" our coins.**

When sketching out your token, answer the following questions. Don't worry about having the perfect concept mapped out, just go with your instincts. Answers to some of these might not make themselves known until you start making the thing.

1. What is the stated goal of your token?
2. If it is different than your stated goal, what is your intended goal? (Put another way, what are you *actually* trying to do with your token)
3. Who can receive the token?
4. Who can distribute the token?
5. What do entities have to do to receive tokens ("Proof-of-X")
6. In what "reality" does this token exist?
   1. Contemporary reality - I imagine this token entering the world as we know it today
   2. Speculative dystopia - I imagine the token in an imagined dystopia/the token creates or adds to the dystopia
   3. Speculative utopia - I imagine the token in an imagined utopia/the token creates or adds to the utopia
   4. Other.
7. (Optional) Are there any perceptual qualities of your token (does it have a logo, a color, a sonic property attached to it?)

Create a slideshow presentation that communicates the aims and properties of your token. We will spend time in the afternoon next week working on these before we present them in class.
