  //////////// DESCRIPTION ////////////
  This is contract allows you to deploy your own cryptocurrency on the
  Ethereum Blockchain in the form of an ERC20 token. This contract extends
  the ERC20 template contract from OpenZeppelin â€“
  (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)
  
  More information about ERC20 tokens:
  https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/
  
  //////////// INSTRUCTIONS ////////////
  Before deploying your contract...
  1. Change the file name from 'MyToken.sol' to 'WhateverYourTokenNameIs.sol'
  2. Change the name of your contract to match your file name.
  3. Change the following parameters of your token:
    3-1. Token name
    3-2. Token symbol
    3-3. Token amount
    3-4. Number of decimals
    3-5. Whether or not your token has a fixed supply
*/

pragma solidity ^0.8.2;
import 'https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol';

// rename MyToken below to match the name of your file name
// for example, if your file is called CoolCoin.sol, the line 34
// would say: contract CoolCoin is ERC20 {
contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    
    string private myTokenName = 'My Token'; // 1. The name of your of your Token
    string private myTokenSymbol = 'MYT'; // 2. A 3-5 letter symbol, like a stock symbol
    bool private isFixedSupply = false; // 3. set to 'true' if you don't want to mint more of this token in the future

    /* A note about decimals and supply in Ethereum. It turns out Ethereum doesn't use
    decimals. If you own 0.5 ETH, that 0.5 is represented in the Ethereum as: 50000000000000000 wei.
    One "wei" is the smallest amount of ETH you could own. 1 wei == 0.000000000000000001 ETH
    So below, for example, if you set totalSupply to 100 for your token, if you use the default decimal amount of 18, your *actual total supply* will be: 100000000000000000000 MYT.
    */
    uint256 private totalSupply = 100; // 4. The amount of tokens you want to create
    uint8 private numDecimals = 0; // 5. The number of decimal places, 0-18 (The ERC20 default is 18)
    
    
    address public admin; // a variable to store the address of the person who deploys the contract
    

    // The constructor is a special function that is run once at the time the contract is deployed.
    // In this case, the constructor mints the tokens to the person who deploys the contracgt
    constructor() ERC20(myTokenName, myTokenSymbol) {
        admin = msg.sender; // sets the admin to the person who deployed the contract (the contract owner)
        _mint(msg.sender, totalSupply * 10 ** decimals()); // mint the tokens to the person deploying the contract, based on the totalSupply times 10 ^number of decimals
    }
    
    // a function to return the number of decimals designated for the token
    function decimals() public view override returns (uint8) {
        return numDecimals;
    }
    
    // the mint function, which allows more tokens to be minted in the future by the contract owner
    // if the token as a fixed supply, additional tokens cannot be minted after the initial contract deployment
    function mint(address to, uint amount) external {
        require(!isFixedSupply, 'fixed supply, cannot mint more');
        require(msg.sender == admin, 'only admin can mint');
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
    
    // the burn function allows any token holder to burn some amount of their own tokens.
    function burn(uint amount) external {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}

// *Fun fact: The Maximum amount of ERC20 tokens you could possibly make:
//
// 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,935
//
// The "amount" property of an ERC20 token uses a uint256 data type to store the number.
// A uint256 can store a number up to 2^256 - 1. That evaluates to approximately 1.15792 * 10^77
// Written out, that number looks like this:
// 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,935
//
// This isn't quite the maximum potential amount of an ERC20 token;
// that maximum depends on how many decimal places your token uses.
// For example, if your token uses the default maximum of 18 decimal places,
// Your maximum total supply of your ERC20 token would be:
//
// (2^256-1)/10^18
//
// or,
//
// 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457.584007913129639935,
// which we'll round down to:
// 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457
//
//
// So there you have it. If you for some reason felt the need to create the absolute maximum amount of
// ERC20 tokens possible, you could set myTotalAmount to:
// 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457
// (and still be able to divide a single one of those tokens up to 18 decimal places)
// Note: if you set your decimals to be a value less than 18, you can find your maximum amount like this:
// (2^256-1)/10^(numDecimals)
//
// If you chose 0 decimals, the absolute maximum you could make would be:
// 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935
