## **COURSE DESCRIPTION**

*"The Internet was about the exchange of information. Blockchain is about exchange of assets and exchange of value."* — Research Fellow, Associate Director – Centre for Cryptocurrency Research, Imperial College

**_Blockchain: The New Internet_** will explore blockchain technology as a material for artistic practice and deep critical engagement. Blockchain—a technology designed for the secure storage and transmission of data on a decentralized network—is still in its relative infancy, yet its integration into the social fabric has had far-reaching transformations. Blockchains, which began as integral technical infrastructure for facilitating digital payments like Bitcoin, has grown to form the foundation of a number of technological systems that have already signficantly changed the way .

Students in this course will learn about current applications of blockchain as well as the technical skills to utilize blockchain technology such as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and the Solidity programming language, and will apply these tools toward crafting blockchain-based art works. We will examine the works of contemporary artists working with and around blockchain technologies today like Sarah Meyoas, Simon Denny, Rob Meyers and Larva Labs, while also exploring the work of conceptual artists that explore the relationship between art, networks and economic value like Piero Manzoni, Justin Gignac and Hans Haacke. Readings will cover aspects of the cultural, historical, philosophical, economic, technical and artistic contexts that intersect with blockchain. Additional screenings and readings will provide technical foundation for blockchain technology. Students will create a mid-term and final project with respective critiques. Weekly homework assignments will incorporate technical exercises to reinforce in-class material and readings to discuss in class.

### ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES:
SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected disabilities, such as a Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental health condition who think they would benefit from assistance or accommodations should first contact the Disability and Learning Resource Center (DLRC) to schedule an appointment. DLRC staff will review your disability documentation and work with you to determine reasonable accommodations. They will then provide you with a letter outlining the approved accommodations for you to deliver to your instructors. This letter must be presented before any accommodations will be implemented. You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible. The DLRC is located within the Wellness Center on the 13th floor of 116 S Michigan Ave. and can be reached via phone at 312.499.4278 or email at dlrc@saic.edu.

### ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT:
From the SAIC Student Handbook:
“Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism and cheating, and may consist of: the submission of the work of another as one’s own; unauthorized assistance on a test or assignment; submission of the same work for more than one class without the knowledge and consent of all instructors; or the failure to properly cite texts or ideas from other sources. Academic misconduct also includes the falsification of academic or student-related records, such as transcripts, evaluations and letters of recommendation. Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite locations and online education.
Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning. It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place, including LDAP authentication, to verify student identity.”
Additional resources for students:
* Read “Plagiarism: How to Recognize It and Avoid It: a short guide prepared by the Faculty Senate Student Life Subcommittee in 2004.
* Read the Flaxman Library’s quick guide titled “When to give credit.”

### ATTENDANCE
SAIC policy states that students are expected to attend all classes regularly and on time. Students should miss class only with reasonable cause. If a student needs to miss class with reasonable cause, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor to receive instruction for how to make up for the missed class. It is the instructor’s responsibility to give this information to the student as his/her/their schedule permits. Missing class for other than a reasonable cause may jeopardize the student’s academic standing in the class. Attendance is required on the two final critique days to receive credit for this course.
<br>

__If a student misses MORE than three classes, whether or not for a reasonable cause, the student will fail the class__, if the student does not withdraw from the class prior to the deadline for withdrawal with a grade  of "W."
__Three late arrivals to the synchronous portion of lecture will count as an absence.__
__Arriving more than 30 minutes late to class will count as an absence__

__Deadline for withdrawal:__ Fall 2020 semester: Tuesday, November 3, 2020
##### Reasonable cause to miss a class might include:
* Illness or hospitalization (the student should also contact Health Services or their academic advisor, who will relay information to
the faculty in whose class the student is enrolled)
* Family illness or death (the student should also contact their academic advisor, who can relay information to all faculty)
* Observation of a religious holiday (students are expected to notify their instructors in advance to discuss reasonable
accommodations for holidays they might observe). <br>

## ATS-SPECIFIC INFORMATION:

### ATS Facilities
Normal ATS facilities access, procedures and policies have changed significantly in response to COVID-19 pandemic.  Please familiarize yourself with ATS facilities availability, capacity, authorizations, reservations, sanitation and other ATS-specific information in the [ATS Facilities Canvas Course](https://saic.instructure.com/enroll/CMMJY3).

### ATS Community
ATS is working to build a strong online and offline community during the COVID-19 pandemic. We strongly encourage all ATS students to sign up for our departmental forum at [https://ats.community](https://ats.community/). Students can find out about visiting artist opportunities, upcoming ATS Town Halls, our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion reading group, special events, participate in discussions, and get help with their projects.

## Community in the time of Covid
We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. We also recognize that in these unprecedented times each of our relationships to art and education are being asked to change in profound and fundamental ways. This course will not ignore the complexities of how the pandemic, current events, and society's evolving practices in health and safety are influencing our daily abilities to learn and engage.

To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit and recognize the many valid and varying experiences that shape the way we inhabit and express ourselves within this classroom. This means that we will use correct pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of each individual's needs. Each student is expected to practice agency in defining their own learning objectives with this course material and contribute to building a supportive environment for others to define and achieve their own learning objectives. Students are also expected to practice self-care- understanding that each of our learning happens differently as the circumstances of our lives fluctuate. Be patient with yourself and be mindful of what your health and body need in an online learning environment to best achieve your goals.  Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, in lieu of defensiveness; this class will work to instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA.
